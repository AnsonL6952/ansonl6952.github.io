            <h1 class="margin text-center">Zombie Movie</h1>
            <h1>Context for the Movie</h1>
            <p>During class of Sep 10 Mr. Mueller wanted us to create our "Movie Webpage Project". We had a lot of coding freedom for this project which we had to also have a partner to do this. We also had to implement our prior Css knowledge to that movie. The only thing I thought while doing this was the opinon of my partner and how we were going to format this.</p>
            <h1>Content</h1>
            <p>Me and my partner decided to make a zombie movie which was sort of a horror/action project. We implemented multiple css directions that Mr. Mueller told in order to get credit we need specific requirements for our project such as to add selectors for our css such as (elements,class,id). We also had to add box models for our images such as (padding,margins and borders) We also had to use creative common license for our images incase of copyright. We also were required to plan our coding using markdown to determine whether me or my partner had to do a certain part of the coding.</p>
            <h1>Challenges</h1>
            <p>Me and my partner were able to finish this project rather easily. We also cooperated with eachother off of school hours and discussed whether adding certain parts of our project would fit our standards or not. We mostly planned out how our zombie project was going to look like and how the story would go. This is where we met out first challenge as me and my partner sometimes had disagreements whether the plot or the writing of the story would go. We later on resolved this issue by implementing both of our ideas together. For example my partner wanted mutant zombies and I wanted the zombies to be the same but far more deadlier, we compromised on this issue by making the zombies somewhat fast but also with a bit of characteritic to each individual zombies aswell for our story.</p>
<p> Another challenged that I faced personally myself was adding the selectors to our css to change their code specifically. I found this hard because I am not as familiar with selectors in Css as it is confusing since it had multiple types of variants to them making it difficult to remember which one we needed to add such as when we needed to add the "#" for our Css or adding the ".". Thankfully I asked my partner for help and she guided me step by step on how to solve this issue she taught me that we use "." only if we gave the text on our html a class so the "." can specify which text to choose and to change it. She also struggled on finding the purpose of how to use "#" for our css which we went back to previous lessons from Mr. Mueller and found out that in order to use # we need to give our text an id and where does it belong which helped us specify our image and which we later used that to give it a div and a border.</p>
           <h1>Takeaways</h1>
            <p>One major takeaway that I got from this project was collaboration and communication with my partner because when we first started this project we had no communication whatsoever and we were confused on who was doing which part, thankfully me and my partner later discussed on this issue and decided to build on it by adding more plans to our markdowns and when one of us was confused on the work, we would help eachother out by guiding eachother which made this project far easier than we first worked on this together. Communication also helped build growth during our work because later on afterschool me and my partner shared contacts with eachother and decided to work on this together later on after school hours, which also improved our efficiency on this project and improve our collaborative work through communication through text. These 2 main Takeaways taught me that communication and cooperation is important because when we first started we thought it really didn't matter that much and we could do our own thing which we later learned wasn't the smartest idea as we were a mess during the start. As we worked we later on decided to communicate and build our project based on communication which is how it turned out to what it is suppose to be.</p>
            <h1>Next steps</h1>
            <p>Next time if we ever get the opportunity to work on this project again or something similar to this. I would've added a better design and maybe even added a logo as I felt like the movie would've been a lot better and made the movie seem a lot more scarier. I would've also worked on the script a bit as i felt it didn't make much sense and didn't fit the overall zombie vibe to the project. Overall I am really proud of what me and my partner achieved as a team.</p>
